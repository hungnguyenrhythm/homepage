</div>
<!-- Favorite movie quote -->
<div id="quote">
	<p>I have my own principles! I just don't want to live like this anymore!!...Do you think I like to beg!?...
	I've been in bad shape for three years, waiting for this opportunity! This is my only chance, not to prove that I'm the best, 
	but to simply take back what I have lost!!!...Look at yourself. Look at what you've become!!...Back then, people rejected you! 
	Now, you can't even take two steps without someone following you!!! Have you ever fought for a chance? You never have. Never!!!
	...I don't want to be like you...</p>
